        Hello and welcome. My name is Henry Mahnke, 
        the photographer behind Sol Studio. Sol Studio is an exhibit of human connection to beauty wherever it is found. 
        This is a story about our interrelation with the physical spaces around us, how they shape our identities, 
        foster vitality, and constitute a canvas for existence. As a climber, surfer, skier, and hiker natural environments 
        are a studio for self-determination and personal expression. These spaces are a medium for fulfillment and 
        connection to the world around us. For years I have revered the Sun as a symbol of this sentiment, 
        and a reminder to be tenacious and intrepid. It is no coincidence that as the brightest light in the universe,
        Sol sounds like soul.
